Read this first.</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Defining a conversion allows us to let you know when someone completes the action you desire. But how do you know when someone completed the action because they saw your ad? In other words, how do you <em>attribute</em> <em>conversions to your campaign</em>?</p>\r\n<table class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\" style=\"background-color: #f9fcfd;\" border=\"2px\">\r\n<tbody class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<tr class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">An Attribution Scenario</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\"><em>On the way to work one morning, a potential customer sees one of your ads on their phone, but they don't click through. Later, on their computer at work, they see a search ad and click through to your website where they do a little research into your products. That night, while they're checking their favorite social app on a tablet, they see a retargeting ad and click through to complete their purchase.</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">In a simple world, your customer would have interacted with your ad once and completed their purchase right away. You could then give that ad 100% of the credit for your new customer. Much more realistic is that your customer could have touched any number of your marketing channels (3, in the above example) that <em>each </em>contribute to your customer making that purchase.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Unless you're in the head of your customer, you will never know exactly how much impact each ad made on the decision to buy. That is why establishing a reasonable attribution model is so important to measuring your campaign's performance.</p>\r\n<p>Attribution is not a perfect science and there are many competing theories to what the most accurate method for determining a realistic attribution model. You can read our guide on attribution here, and we definitely encourage you to do some research on your own to find the attribution model that is right for you.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>How do I adjust attribution for AdRoll?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Attribution can be adjusted in \"Attribution Settings\". Find this section in settings by clicking the <em>gear</em> icon in the top right corner. There you will find the option to adjust attribution for both your click-through conversions and view-through conversions.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Click-through conversions</strong> are conversions that resulted after someone clicked on one of your ads.</li>\r\n<li><strong>View-through conversions</strong> are conversions that resulted after someone viewed one of your ads.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For each of these types of conversions, you have two levers to adjust: conversion window and attribution %.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Conversion Windows</span></p>\r\n<p>Your <strong>conversion window</strong>, or the number of days that can elapse after your visitor's interaction with your ad within which the conversion will be attributed to your campaign.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A <strong>30-day conversion window</strong> means that if your customer converts <em>within 30-days</em> after viewing or clicking on your ad, the campaign that served the ad will get credit for it.</li>\r\n<li>A <strong>5-day conversion window</strong> means that if someone converts <em>6 days after</em> seeing or clicking on your ad, the campaign that served the ad will not get credit for it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A realistic conversion window will take into account your sales cycle, or how much time it might realistically take your customer to make a decision to buy. For example, it likely takes someone longer to decide to buy a car than it would a pair of socks.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Attribution Percentage</span></p>\r\n<p>Your <strong>attribution %</strong> controls what portion of attributable conversions are actually credited to your campaign. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If you attribute <strong>100%</strong> of conversions, all attributable conversions that occur within your conversion window will be credited to your campaign.</li>\r\n<li>If you attribute <strong>50%</strong> of conversions, only half of total attributable conversions that occurred within your conversion window will count.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>What the attribution % allows you to do is programmatically adjust attributed conversions based on consideration for likely impacts. For example, if you have more than one active marketing channel (like in the scenario above) that may have contributed to the ultimate conversion.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Attribution for View-Through Conversions</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">One of the simplest ways to measure the success of your online campaigns is to track click-through conversions - you know that your visitor clicked on your ad and then converted into a customer as a result.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">View-through conversions are a little trickier since there is no definitive action to show that your visitor engaged with your ad. But remember, not everyone clicks!  In fact, s</span>tudies have shown that only 16% of people ever click, and half of those (8%) <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2009/10/comScore_and_Starcom_USA_Release_Updated_Natural_Born_Clickers_Study_Showing_50_Percent_Drop_in_Number_of_U.S._Internet_Users_Who_Click_on_Display_Ads\" target=\"_blank\">account for 85%</a> of all clicks on display ads.</p>\r\n<p>Even if a customer does not click on your ad - whether its because they got distracted or prefer to follow up on your offer in a different window or day - the ad has still served as a compelling reminder of your brand. And this brand recognition does result in a lift in conversions.

Measuring VTCs reveals the true value of campaigns that raise awareness of your brand to keep it top of mind.</p>\r\n<table class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\" style=\"background-color: #f9fcfd;\" border=\"2px\">\r\n<tbody class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<tr class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Not sure what to specify?</span></p>\r\n<p>There is no single way to value view-through conversions, but in a study of the 93% of marketers (that's a big majority) that <em>do</em> attribute view-through conversions, most attribute around 25% of VTCs within a 30 day window and 100% for CTCs.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p> </p>",
