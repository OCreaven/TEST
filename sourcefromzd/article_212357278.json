This is so when you un-pause we have the credit needed to immediately resume your campaign.</p>\r\n<p>If you need to lower your required balance or are not planning on resuming your campaign any time soon, consider completing your campaign. Ads are saved in your <em>Ads</em> library so you can relaunch easily if you change your mind.</p>",
