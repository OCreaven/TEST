We can help you set up multiple billing accounts, however at this time this feature does not exist on the dashboard. If you need to pay for your Advertiser Profiles separately, please reach out to your account manager for help. Click <a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/212011838\">here</a> if you're not sure what we mean by <em>Advertiser Profiles</em>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we create new billing accounts for each of your profiles, the credit card or PayPal account you already have set as default will be copied over. If you want your profile to be billed on a different card or account, please update payment on your profile right away. Click <a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/214632787\">here</a> to learn how to update or delete payment methods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once set up, moving forward each profile requested will be billed separately, but we cannot take retroactive action on past invoices.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">What currencies do you support?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our dashboard defaults to <strong>US Dollars (USD)</strong>. If you would like to have your account currency adjusted to one of the following, please reach out to your account manager or delight@adroll.com:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>AUD</strong>, Australian Dollar</li>\r\n<li><strong>EUR</strong>, Euro</li>\r\n<li><strong>GBP</strong>, British Pound</li>\r\n<li><strong>JPY</strong>, Japanese Yen</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Please note, any adjustments made will only reflect on your dashboard and invoices moving forward.</p>",
