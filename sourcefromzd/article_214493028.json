The following may lead to disapproval:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You do not own the majority of content on your website</li>\r\n<li>Products offered are otherwise available for free </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"afl\"></a><strong>Affiliates</strong></span><br />Affiliates are advertisers who earn commission on traffic or business sent to third-party partners. We work directly with businesses to help retarget their visitors, not individual or organized affiliates. This is in line with our policy that the website in review must demonstrate added value.</p>\r\n<p>Signals we use to identify affiliate businesses:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Redirecting destination URLs </li>\r\n<li>Websites whose purchasing links send visitors to third-party pages (except for ticketing services such as Ticketmaster) </li>\r\n<li>Reseller programs </li>\r\n<li>Mirror sites (websites that mimic the look and feel of another) not owned by the original entity </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"agr\"></a><strong>Aggregators</strong></span><br />Aggregators are websites that compile third-party content and links so visitors can easily assess their options. This does add value, but make sure that you add value with original content as well to ensure your campaign is approved.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"air\"></a><strong>Airsoft guns</strong></span><br />We cannot promote airsoft guns or similar products that discharge projectiles at high velocity with the potential to injure (shoots things).</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"alc\"></a><strong>Alcohol</strong></span><br />We are typically not able to promote alcohol sales. In cases where advertisers qualify, their campaigns require the help of an account manager so we can be sure that they're set up with the appropriate restrictions. If you don't sell alcohol or it's a small part of your business, make sure that you do not have anything that could be interpreted as alcohol in your marketing content. </p>\r\n<p>We can promote venues or events that sell alcohol legally. Again, make sure that your ads don't have any alcohol or alcohol-related activities pictured.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"psy\"></a><strong>Astrology/psychics</strong></span><br />We're open to the possibilities of the unknown, but in line with our policy on unverifiable claims, we cannot promote astrology, psychics, or related businesses.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"blg\"></a><strong>Blogs/forums</strong></span><br />We cannot promote personal blogs or forums. If you use blogs and forums as community or marketing tools, we can work with you as long as it's clear that your business goes beyond the blog or forum by providing clear links to the homepage of your main website.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"cos\"></a><strong>Cosmetic surgery</strong></span><br />We can promote cosmetic surgery services as long as content is family-safe. If your practice specializes in procedures involving breasts or genitalia, be careful with what you picture. Censor any sensitive areas and make sure that you are not implying an ideal body type with any of your content.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"par\"></a><strong>Drug paraphernalia</strong></span><br />We cannot promote any products, services or content that involve illegal drugs.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"edu\"></a><strong>Education services/academic aids</strong></span><br />We can promote education services, programs, or products designed to help people, but make sure they follow these guidelines:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The offer and proposed value are clear and specific. </li>\r\n<li>All claims made are accurate, credible and verifiable. </li>\r\n<li>Costs are fully disclosed upfront.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Examples of accepted education businesses are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Tutoring services</li>\r\n<li>Online courses or programs backed by a reputable organization</li>\r\n<li>School supply distributors</li>\r\n<li>Institutions of higher education.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Programs that are designed as academic “shortcuts” or to achieve some exaggerated result will not be approved, including academic aid providers (businesses that sell essays or services to complete coursework), or programs that claim to teach individuals how to \"Make money, FAST!\".</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"fin\"></a><strong>Financial services</strong></span><br />Financial services will be closely reviewed for credibility, user safety, and accuracy of claims.</p>\r\n<p>We cannot promote:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cash, payday, or title loans are prohibited. </li>\r\n<li>Stock or other financial advice programs that guarantee success or exaggerate potential returns will not be approved, even if this is only a portion of your offering. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To be approved, make sure:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your website content focuses on the financial tools you offer, not potential returns. Exaggerating returns is grounds for disapproval. </li>\r\n<li>The terms of your offers are clearly laid out to guide visitors through the full extent of financial considerations. </li>\r\n<li>Verification of performance or accreditation claims are easily accessible. </li>\r\n<li>Any request for sensitive personal information is completed on secure processing servers (https;//). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"sup\"></a><strong>Health supplements</strong></span><br />Supplements are diet additives that synthesize natural ingredients in order to fulfill a desired result. Because of questionable legality and verification of claims, we cannot promote health supplements that:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Are designed for physical enhancement (for example, weight loss, body building, or rejuvenation) </li>\r\n<li>Claim to be as effective as (or a suitable replacement for) medicines </li>\r\n<li>Claim benefits that cannot be easily verified </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"gen\"></a><strong>Lead generation</strong></span><br />We cannot promote lead generation websites. This is defined as websites that have a primary purpose to collect personal information from visitors. Dedicated landing pages that contain a form for visitors to fill out can be approved, but only if it is associated with a business that offers more than lead generation.</p>\r\n<p>Any information collected should be necessary for your business’s operations. For example to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fulfill a request or provide customer support </li>\r\n<li>Complete a transaction </li>\r\n<li>Create an account </li>\r\n<li>Enroll the visitor in an opt-in newsletter program </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Signals we use to identify lead generation websites:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Missing or incomplete privacy policy </li>\r\n<li>Single-page websites </li>\r\n<li>Offers for free products or services in exchange for personal information or taking a survey </li>\r\n<li>Offers for future access to products or services in exchange for personal information now </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"bra\"></a><strong>Lingerie/hosiery</strong></span><br />Stores that sell lingerie, online or offline, can be promoted so long as store offerings and presentation of products in both your ads and website are tasteful (family-safe).</p>\r\n<p>To be approved:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You website cannot contain any nudity. To determine if your content complies with this rule, use the \"bikini test\". Any areas that would be covered by an opaque two-piece swimsuit cannot be exposed. Unfortunately, if nipples are visible our partner networks will not allow your campaign to run.</li>\r\n<li>Avoid any explicit or implicit references to adult activities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"mkg\"></a><strong>Marketing</strong></span><br />We work with many agencies to help promote their clients, but when it comes to retargeting your own marketing business, there are extra guideline to keep in mind.</p>\r\n<p>To be approved:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your marketing tool or service must be designed to assist in marketing strategy. </li>\r\n<li>Programs should be customizable to cater to specific client needs. </li>\r\n<li>Potential customers should have a clear and full understanding of the services offered. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Examples of what we can approve:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Analytics providers </li>\r\n<li>Agencies (client websites must be compliant with our site requirements) </li>\r\n<li>Social media management platforms or tools </li>\r\n<li>Website optimization tools </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We cannot approve:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>“One-size-fits-all” marketing solutions </li>\r\n<li>Marketing tools or programs that claim exaggerated returns </li>\r\n<li>Reputation management systems designed to inflate social media presence (e.g., buying traffic or Facebook likes), alter review ratings, or otherwise manipulate a business’ digital presence (e.g., selling backlinks) in exchange for money or personal information. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"med\"></a><strong>Medical Devices</strong></span><br />We can promote general hospital and first aid supplies (bandages, scrubs, gloves). We cannot promote the sale of medical devices used to treat specific physical or mental conditions because it implies the personal conditions of the target audience.</p>\r\n<p><br /><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"gmb\"></a><strong>Online gaming/gambling</strong></span><br />We cannot promote online gambling services or content.</p>\r\n<p>This includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Free or paid casino games </li>\r\n<li>Games of chance or skill that involve monetary wagers or rewards </li>\r\n<li>Gambling content refers to the following:</li>\r\n<li>Gambling-related promotional products (e.g., vouchers, gambling credit) </li>\r\n<li>Gambling software or programs </li>\r\n<li>Gambling-related strategy, advice, or information </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Government-sponsored lotteries, casino supplies (e.g., cards, chips), and brick-and-mortar casinos (gambling establishments) that comply with legal age requirements can be promoted, but requires the help of an account manager so we can be sure that they're set up with the appropriate restrictions.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong><a name=\"auc\"></a><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Penny auctions</span></strong><br />Penny auctions are bidding websites that require a non-refundable fee in order to place a bid on any item or service.

If you have a marketable skill or craft and have made a business of it, reach out to the Customer Delight team with your website URL and we’d be happy to check it for eligibility.
