    "body": "<p>Segmentation is a way of organizing user intent for advertising targeting. By creating segments, an advertiser can display highly tailored ads to potential customers whoâ€™ve visited a specific page on their site (e.g., shopping cart, homepage, pants, shirts).</p>\r\n<p>Segmentation strategies vary between <a href=\"#1\">business-to-consumer clients (B2C)</a> and <a href=\"#2\">business-to-business clients (B2B)</a>.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"1\"></a><strong>Recommended B2C Segments</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>The following segments represent different areas of the purchase funnel. We recommend that you create each of these before you launch your campaign:</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">1. All Visitors</span></p>\r\n<p>When you sign up, we automatically create a segment that includes everyone who visits your homepage. Targeting all visitors lets you engage consumers who show the lowest intent, and ultimately bring them down the funnel.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2.</span> <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Product</span></p>\r\n<p>Users who have gone to a specific product page belong in a product segment. Targeting a product segment lets you engage middle-of-the-funnel users who have shown some interest in products. This segment allows you to use unique creative, tailored to the product viewed. The ultimate goal is to drive conversions and push this user from an interested comparison shopper to someone who puts the product in their cart and makes a purchase.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">3.</span> <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Cart Segment</span></p>\r\n<p>Users who have visited the cart page are your lowest-hanging fruit. Targeting this high-intent segment lets you remind users to finish their purchase (and drive up your ROI).  The cart segment is essential to any successful B2C retargeting campaign.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">4.</span> <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Conversion Segment</span></p>\r\n<p>Users who have made a purchase and reached a Thank You page belong in a conversion segment. This lets you target them for loyalty programs or exclude them from retargeting campaigns designed to convert first-time purchasers.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Cookie duration</span></p>\r\n<p>Typical cookie duration for this type of campaign is around 30 days. This is highly dependent upon the sales cycle of the company, as the cookie duration should match the sales cycle.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"2\"></a><strong><strong>B2B recommended segments</strong></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>There are three crucial segments to build that should be the core of any B2B retargeting campaign:</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">1. All Visitors</span></p>\r\n<p>When you sign up, we automatically create a segment that includes everyone who visits your homepage. Targeting all visitors lets you engage consumers who show the lowest intent, and ultimately bring them down the funnel.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2. Pricing page</span></p>\r\n<p>Users who have looked at pricing info have a higher interest in your product. Create a segment for this middle-of-the-funnel group.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">3. Free trial request</span></p>\r\n<p>Users who have request a free trial or more info are equivalent to the conversion segment in B2C accounts.  This user has shown the highest intent on the website and has opted for  a free trial. You may want to exclude this segment from retargeting campaigns designed to convert casual browsers.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Cookie duration</span></p>\r\n<p>Typical cookie duration for this type of campaign is around 60-90 days. Typically a B2B company will have a longer sales cycle,  which correlates to the longer cookie duration. This is highly dependent upon the sales cycle of the company, as the cookie duration should match the sales cycle.</p>",
