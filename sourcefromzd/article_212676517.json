Know your audience, design for retargeting</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Leave your preconceptions about who your audience is at the door. It is important to approach your audience with an open mind and constantly evolve your strategy. Continuing to try new strategies with your ads will help you to understand your audience better (what works? what doesn’t work?) and to maintain high campaign performance over time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Take the time to get to know your customers.</strong> Figure out what they value.</p>\r\n<p>So where is a good place to start? One thing is true of all retargeting campaign audiences: they’ve already been to your website.</p>\r\n<p>It may seem obvious, but it makes a significant difference in your ad strategy. The goal is not to introduce your brand to your audience - you've already done that. <strong>The goal with your ads is to renew and refine their interest in what you have to offer.</strong></p>\r\n<table border=\"2px\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\">\r\n<td width=\"100px\"><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204817707/bestpractices_refine_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></td>\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Refine the visitor’s understanding of your business</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr bgcolor=\"#f9fcfd\">\r\n<td><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204817717/bestpractices_remind_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></td>\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Justify the value of your offering</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\">\r\n<td><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204796898/bestpractices_value_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></td>\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Remind the visitor of their interest </span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr bgcolor=\"#f9fcfd\">\r\n<td><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204817727/bestpractices_highlight_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></td>\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Highlight a product or feature that they may have missed the first time they visited your website</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\">\r\n<td><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204817737/bestpractices_incentives_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></td>\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Provide additional incentive to convert</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"2\"></a><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2. Creating Engaging Ads</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>When creating web ads, <strong>think simple</strong>. The web is a very busy place, so keeping your image and message clean is the key to drawing your visitor’s eye.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204817817/bestpractices_simple_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Your ad should be a balance of image and text. <strong>Identify your strongest selling point, and be concise.</strong> Any messaging should be reinforced by images used to compel that click.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204817827/bestpractices_bold_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Your ad is competing not only with other ads, but website content. Use bold typography and strong, relevant images to make your ad pop. As a rule of thumb, <strong>white backgrounds rarely stand out</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204796978/bestpractices_logo_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Clicks may be the strongest indicator of ad engagement, but seeing your brand prominently as they go about their business can have a huge impact on keeping your brand top of mind (and first in line when your visitor is ready to make that commitment). Make sure that your brand is prominent within your ad. <strong>Place your logo prominently</strong>, and use contrasting background colors to help it stand out.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204817837/bestpractices_freeshipping_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>If you’re going after that click, <strong>give your visitor an incentive to follow through</strong>. Promotions such as exclusive discounts or free shipping are small tactics that go a long way to compel that click, get that customer back to your website, and drive that conversion.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204817847/bestpractices_cta_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>You’ve caught your visitor’s attention; now shouldn’t you let them know what you want them to do? <strong>A strong call to action helps give visitors that extra little push</strong> they need to click your ad.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"3\"></a><strong>3. Effective Facebook Ads</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>When creating Facebook ads, <strong><strong>take into consideration all ad elements at your disposal</strong></strong>. You have title and body text (and for News Feed, an optional message) to work with, so make your ad copy (our fancy word for message) count.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204796988/bestpractices_facebook_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Facebook is a social network, so use your text fields to encourage<strong><strong> your visitors to be social</strong></strong>. Ask questions in your message or title. Have your visitors “Like if you agree!” If your visitors like, share or comment on your ad, it becomes part of their Facebook activity. The more interaction your visitors have with your ad, the more likely your post will start to appear naturally (for free!) on their friends' news feeds. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204797008/bestpractices_sale_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong><strong>Capitalization can help draw attention to key words or ideas</strong></strong> (for example, SALE or NEW or LIMITED), but excessive capitalization will work against you by making your ad appear spammy or may even cause Facebook to suspend your ad. <strong><strong>The same goes for a well-placed exclamation mark!!</strong></strong> Use these tools with purpose, and don’t overdo it.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204817867/bestpratices_vibrant_en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Facebook’s website background is white, so <strong><strong>use colorful images to draw the eye</strong></strong>. Posts that have been seen before are likely to be skipped over, so make sure that you <strong><strong>keep your campaign fresh</strong></strong> by starting with variety of creative assets, and refreshing them periodically.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"4\"></a><strong>4. Variety is the spice of life (and retargeting)</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><strong>We Work Better Together</strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><strong><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204797018/bestpractices_together.en-us.gif\" alt=\"\" /></strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>The three most popular web ad sizes (300x250, 160x600, and 728x90) represent the majority of available inventory - make sure you have them. <strong><strong>Upload ads in as many sizes are you can. </strong></strong>You don't want to miss out on a potential high value impression because you didn't have an ad in that size.</p>\r\n<p>But variety is not just limited to ad sizes for web. Having variety in Facebook campaigns is important, too. Different types of creative may appeal to different individuals in your audience pool. <strong><strong>Test a variety of ad messaging to increase your ability to engage everyone in your audience.</strong></strong></p>\r\n<p>Finally, it is important to consider variety in the long run. To combat the onset of banner fatigue (diminishing impact each time you see an ad), <strong><strong>make sure that you update your campaign creative periodically</strong></strong> so your audience isn’t stuck seeing the same ad over, and over, and over, and over, and over….</p>",
