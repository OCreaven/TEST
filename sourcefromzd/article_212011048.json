Once enabled, a 6-digit verification code will be sent to your phone each time your credentials are used to log into AdRoll. Requiring both your password and your phone to gain access means that your data stays safe, and also alerts you to any unauthorized attempts to gain access to your account! To get started:</div>\r\n<div class=\"entry-content\"> </div>\r\n<div class=\"entry-content\">1. Log into your AdRoll account.</div>\r\n<div class=\"entry-content\"><img src=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202430364/1B8a_en-us.png\" alt=\"\" /> \r\n<p>2.
