The technology uses advanced machine learning techniques to determine the optimal bid price for each impression, and analyzes user behavior to serve the right ad to the right user at the right time.</p>\r\n<p><em>BidIQ</em> determines a bid value in real time based on the intersection of the user's intent signals, the quality of the ad inventory, and other factors, like how recently a user exhibited intent and how many ads they've already seen. This allows us to deliver a bid for every impression that reflects the true value at that moment.</p>\r\n<table class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\" style=\"background-color: #f9fcfd;\" border=\"2px\">\r\n<tbody class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<tr class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>BidIQ: Benefits</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">BidIQ will do the heavy (performance) lifting so you don’t have to.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<li><strong>Drive more conversions</strong> - BidIQ optimizes toward clicks and conversions - delivering more value with less money.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Spend efficiently</strong> - Put your money to work on your highest intent visitors instead of your “window shoppers”.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Automatic optimization</strong> - BidIQ learns about your unique campaign performance and uses findings to fine-tune bidding.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Evaluate each impression uniquely -</strong> We use hundreds of signals from visitor activity leading up to the bid to predict how valuable each impression really is.<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">How Do I Activate BidIQ For My Campaigns?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>BidIQ is active by default for all of our real time bidding inventory sources, across web and Facebook.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Can I control my BidIQ bids or set a max CPM?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>BidIQ drives performance by bidding uniquely for every impression, submitting high bids for high-quality impressions and high-intent users and bidding lower for low quality impressions. The average of these bids determines your CPM (cost per thousand impressions). Since we do not want to keep your campaign from going after visitors that are really likely to convert, we do not impose a maximum CPM on our bidding algorithm.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">What does this mean for you?</span></p>\r\n<p>It is important to take into consideration all cost metrics when evaluating your campaign performance: CPM, CPC (cost per click), and CPA (cost per acquisition). CPM is a measure of your <em>operating</em> costs, while CPC and CPA are better measures of the <em>value</em> that your campaign is driving.</p>\r\n<p>If we're buying fewer impressions with your budget (increased CPM) but ultimately driving more clicks and conversions with these impressions (decreased CPC or CPA), this means that we're hitting the right impressions to help drive optimal <em>performance</em>. In other words, quality over quantity.</p>\r\n<p>That being said, if you have a CPM target we can work with you to get within the ballpark of that number. Please reach out to delight@adroll.com or your account manager who can help with adjustments to hit your goals.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Can I set a target CPC or CPA?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Not currently, but we are planning to add this functionality to the platform in the future. For now, if you’re not happy with your CPC or CPA, please reach out to delight@adroll.com or your account manager for help.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Do advanced campaign settings (like Geotargeting) impact BidIQ performance?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>BidIQ will automatically adjust bids to factor in location and time of day. If your product or service is only available in certain regions, use the broadest geotargets possible so that BidIQ can optimize across all possible geographies.</p>",
