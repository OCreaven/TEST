You have the option to create additional audience segments to further group your website visitors based on their interactions with your business. How you decide to organize your website visitors is up to you, but the goal with segments is to better engage your visitors based on either what their interest is or how high their intent (to convert) is.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Interests</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">Creating a category based on the particular interest someone showed on your website can help you make sure that your message caters to the audience who will receive it the best.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">Let’s say you own a flower shop that sells flower arrangements, balloons, and gift baskets. A new set of gift baskets has come in and you want to promote this product category. Rather than serving your gift basket ads to everyone who comes to your site, what if you could serve these ads to people you know are interested in gift baskets? By creating a segment, you will be able to create an Ad Group that serves gift basket ads specifically to people have viewed your gift basket pages.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Intent</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">Creating a category based on their level of intent helps you identify visitors who are just passing through and those that are really in the market for what you have to offer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">For online stores (e-commerce), a cart segment is a great example of segment that represents really high-intent visitors - they made it all the way to your cart page and all they need is a little nudge to make that purchase. </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">For those of us that work outside of the retail space, there are other behaviors that you can use to gauge intent. For example, the number of pages they’ve visited on your website. Someone who only looked at your homepage is indicating less intent to convert than someone who takes the time to read through more than one page.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">How do I create audience segments?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>You have a couple options for how to capture interest or intent. You can do this by creating a segment based on:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>URL</li>\r\n<li>A fixed page</li>\r\n<li>An event</li>\r\n<li>The number of pages they viewed</li>\r\n<li>Email lists</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">URL Segments</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">As the name suggests, URL segments define your audience based on the URL of pages they visit. If you define a segment based on the URL of a specific page, this segment will capture anyone who views that page.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">Alternately, you can also define a segment based on a portion of a URL. This will capture visitors who land on any URL on your website that contains that URL pattern. This is by far the most versatile segmentation strategy and can be used in both audience and conversion segments.</p>\r\n<p><em>Click <a href=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/201958950#content-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to learn how to set up URL segments.</em></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Fixed Segments</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">If there is a page on your website that represents something very specific, it might make sense to fix it to a particular segment. A good example is your conversion page. Creating a fixed segment guarantees that regardless of your other segments or changes to your website, traffic to that page will always be logged in the specific segment of your choosing.</p>\r\n<p><em>Click <a href=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/203637220#content-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to learn how to set up fixed segments.</em></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Event Segments</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">Sometimes, you’ll want to define an audience based on an event triggered rather than what pages they looked at. If that event is accompanied by a URL change, you can create this segment using URL segmentation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">However, if the event is triggered off a button (and does not result in a change in URL), an event segment will help you capture anyone that interacts with (clicks) that button. A good example of when you would use this type of segment is to capture visitors who submitted a form on your website.</p>\r\n<p><em>Click <a href=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/203637220#content-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to learn more about event segments.</em></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Pages Viewed Segments</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">This web-only segment allows you to organize your audience based on a minimum number of pages they looked at while on your website. While certainly not the only indicator of visitor intent, a good rule of thumb is that the more pages someone views, the more interested they are in what you have to offer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">This type of segment works best for retail websites, where visitors are typically shopping through a number of product pages.</p>\r\n<p><em>Click <a href=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/203637220#content-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to learn more about pages viewed segments.</em></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Email Lists</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">CRM data onboarding allows you to leverage email lists in your campaigns. If you conduct part of your business off your website, want to re-engage old customers, have a seasonal offering or simply need to build on your existing campaign audience, CRM is a helpful supplement to your other segment types.</p>\r\n<p><em>Click <a href=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/203773830#content-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to learn more about CRM data onboarding.</em></p>",
