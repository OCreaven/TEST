If there are any errors in your credit card number or expiration date, you should be prompted to correct this. <br /> <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">4. </span>Call your card issuer to see if they are blocking the transaction. Certain cards have heightened security protocols that may require you to explicitly authorize recurring charges from AdRoll.com. Since we are based in the US, some banks and credit card issuers outside of the United States may have additional restrictions on international charges. </p>",
