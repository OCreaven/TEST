    "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Your SmartPixel is a JavaScript code snippet that you place in the footer of your site, just above the &lt;/body&gt; tag. The pixel has been specially engineered to load asynchronously and independently, so it will never block page load.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article explains SmartPixel features and functionality. To learn how to add your SmartPixel to your website, click <a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/211845978\">here</a>. You can also check if we have instructions specific to your website, <a href=\"/hc/en-us/categories/201557907\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Is my SmartPixel unique?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Your SmartPixel is uniquely generated when you create an AdRoll account. If you create additional advertiser profiles (for managing multiple websites) on your account, we generate additional unique SmartPixels for you so you can keep your website data clean.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To check if the SmartPixel placed on your website will send data back to the correct dashboard, verify that the <em>Advertiser ID</em> or <em>adroll_adv_id</em><em> (</em>X) and <em>Pixel ID</em> or <em>adroll_pix_id</em> (Y) of the SmartPixel on your website matches the one on your dashboard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204263817/smartpixel_ids_en-us.png\" alt=\"\" /> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Cross Device ID (optional)</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Your SmartPixel has the optional ability to recognize a unique visitor across devices (usually via a hashed version of a login identifier such as email). Once you provide a cross device id to AdRoll, the system will enable your ads to be shown on other devices that your visitor uses, even if they only visited your website on a single device.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204263827/smartpixel_uncomment.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>This option is already in your SmartPixel, but you have to activate it.</strong></p>\r\n<table class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\" style=\"background-color: #e5e5e5;\" border=\"2px\">\r\n<tbody class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<tr class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Activating Cross-Device IDs</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">1.</span><strong> </strong>Add your SmartPixel to your website.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2. </span>Uncomment the <strong>adroll_email</strong> variable by removing the two leading slashes (//)</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">3. </span>Specify your website's unique variable name for capturing the email of the current user session.*</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>*In our example we used {<em>{user.email}}</em> as the variable name, but this will differ depending on your website. If you are not sure what variable name to insert, reach out to your technical team and ask:</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">\"</span>I want to learn more about what types of information are collected when a user visits my website. For example, what variable identifies the email associated with each user session?<span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\"> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Do I need to be concerned about visitor privacy?</span></p>\r\n<p>Any emails your SmartPixel picks up will be hashed before they are sent to AdRoll’s servers. This hashing process turns your visitor’s email into an alphanumeric ID that cannot be reversed to reveal the original email. For example, if <a href=\"mailto:delight@adroll.com\">delight@adroll.com</a> is picked up by your SmartPixel, the data we receive will look something like this: 1a6db799f3ba9fbd377c7cf26dba86d2.</p>\r\n<p>This allows us to match a user with a common ID as they move from their desktop computer to their mobile device (and vice versa) without directly collecting or using sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) such as an actual email address.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Finally, the connection between the client browser and AdRoll’s ad servers will be forced to use secure http (https) so you can be sure that any data transmitted makes it to our servers safely.</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Technical Details</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Your SmartPixel is an asynchronous JavaScript code that is designed to load quickly without interfering with any other elements on the page.The pixel simply adds an image to the &lt;head&gt; element of your code and ignores the page otherwise. We register a callback with the browser that is enacted at the end of the rendering process. No other DOM elements are transferred or manipulated. Even if Internet connection to AdRoll’s CDN and our servers was interrupted, your page load would not be blocked.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To ensure very fast loading regardless of the user’s geographical location, our pixel content is delivered from Akamai, the #1 global content delivery network (CDN).</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The SmartPixel dynamically handles both http and https.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The code has been vigorously tested by both our engineers and the developers of third-party data systems.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",
