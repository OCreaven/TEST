You can use dayparting to select specific days that you want your ads to serve (or not to serve), or specific times of day.</p>\r\n<p>Dayparting affects the campaign as a whole, and cannot be applied to specific ad groups only.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">How do I set up dayparting?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Dayparting cannot be set up on your dashboard. Please consult your Account Manager or the Customer Delight team for help with this!</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>When is this useful?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Dayparting is useful when you know that your ads will have a greater impact on certain days of the week or times of the day.</p>\r\n<p>For example, your pizza parlor has noticed that you sell more pizzas during the weekend. You also notice that your business picks up in the afternoon and evening (for lunch and dinner), but mornings are slow.</p>\r\n<table style=\"background-color: #f9fcfd;\" border=\"2px\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Use dayparting to boost business</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">1.</span> <strong>Focus your efforts on when people are looking</strong>. Start a campaign that offers \"One topping free!\" during peak times for lunch, dinner, and the weekend. You know that people are hungry for pizzas during lunch and dinner, so offer a promotion when you know that people are looking to ensure that they order from you. </p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2.</span> <strong>Grow traffic when business is slow</strong>. Your parlor is lonely during week days. Start a campaign that offers \"$5 Weekday Pizzas!\" at lunch and dinner Monday - Thursday. Offer a promotion that entices new customers during the week at times where you know that pizza is popular.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">3.</span> <strong>Break into breakfast.</strong> You're plenty busy during lunch and dinner, but your breakfast offering needs a little help. Start a campaign that promotes \"Free Coffee with your Breakfast Sandwich!\" in the morning. This takes advantage of your robust afternoon and evening traffic to increase awareness and customers for breakfast.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>",
