When you set up your ads, you want to set up multiple versions so you can do some A/B testing. Make subtle changes to your ads so that, over time, you can keep rotating ads in that will keep your performance up and your campaign healthy. It might seem like a minor detail, but refreshing ads can help avoid creative fatigue and keep your brand fresh in the minds of customers. It also leads to better campaign performance. Here are a few best practices:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Add 2–3 new ads every month for each of your web campaigns. If you are running on Facebook, then use 6–8 ads per month.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For web, make sure you have 160x600, 300x250, and 728x90 ads in your campaigns. These ad sizes represent the majority of available inventory on the web.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure ads are socially relevant and factor in seasonal events. If you time ads around holidays or special events, they will be more effective.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure your ads have an incentive or call to action (CTA).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Set up your campaign for success</strong></span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once you have your ad strategy nailed down, the next area to focus on should be campaign setup. It’s important to make sure you target your audience correctly. Target lists with durations that match your sales cycle. For some that may be 30 days, for others, 180 days. Select the appropriate cookie duration based on what performs best for your business. We recommend starting with a 90-day cookie duration for most of your segments.  Here are some additional setup ideas:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Build multiple segments from the most-visited pages on your site. Pay special attention to pages in your conversion funnel, so you can capture all relevant traffic in a segment that may be useful for targeting.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you have an e-commerce site, use categories for segments. This will let you run campaigns for a specific type of customer and customize your creative accordingly. It will also prevent your ads from being shown to people who might not be interested.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Create a segment for people who reach the order completion or thank you page. Setting up conversion tracking will be an important part of measuring your success. It is also important for excluding users who have already made a purchase from your retargeting campaign.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Know which countries might not be good for your campaign. Be sure to geo-target to the markets where you do business, or are trying to build your business.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many people will show ads to converted users. If that strategy makes sense for you, set up two campaigns. The first should drive users to convert, then the second will encourage converted users perform another action. This will let you align spend and ad creative to your business goals and ensure that you are not wasting money on ads that are not targeting the right audience.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",
