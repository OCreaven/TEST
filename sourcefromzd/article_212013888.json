Changing fonts, colors, images, and calls to action can make the difference between a lower- and higher-performing ad.</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pro tip: Little changes can make a big impact. Test ads by using the same image but different colors or copy. Let them both run for about 10,000 impressions, and then pause or remove the underperformer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Rotate creative to prevent ad fatigue. Keep your ads fresh by switching out your creative every 2 to 3 weeks. The rotation window may vary depending on your frequency caps and number of users in your user list.</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pro tip: In addition to your rotation schedule, switch out your creative whenever an ad’s performance starts to drop.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Grab their attention</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Keep running different promotions and test free offers, discounts, one-day promos, or loyalty programs to drive additional Facebook Likes or sales.</li>\r\n<li>Punctuation and grammar are key in grabbing your users’ attention.
