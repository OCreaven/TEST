This may result in an excess of credit in your account balance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If you have other active campaigns remaining</strong>, your credit will be applied to cover their spend as they continue to draw from your account balance. This often means that you will not be charged as much to refill your account balance for the next week. In some cases, there may be enough excess credit to fully cover spend on your other campaign(s) for the week, so no amount will be owed and you will not be charged.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If you no longer have any active campaigns</strong>, you can leave credit in your account if you plan on launching another campaign soon. Otherwise, it probably makes sense to be refunded the excess credit. Let the Delight team know via email and we'll get it done!</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Can I relaunch a completed campaign?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Completed campaigns cannot be reactivated, however all ads are saved in your <em>Ads</em> library so you can easily re-create your campaign. If you would like assistance with relaunching your campaign, feel free to reach out to the Delight team and we'll copy your campaign for you.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
