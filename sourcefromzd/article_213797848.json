Every week, your previous seven days of ad deliveries will be deducted from your total balance. We will then charge your credit card to replenish your account balance back to its original weekly budget level.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">I have promotional credit.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If your promotional credit is not sufficient to the required balance, you may be charged so we have enough credit to fulfill your budget. Reasons for this might be:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your promotional credit is not sufficient to cover the budget of your first campaign</li>\r\n<li>You subsequently increased your campaign budget</li>\r\n<li>You launched a second campaign</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Want to double check?</em> To verify if your promotional credit was applied upon launching your first campaign, go to <a href=\"https://app.adroll.com/dashboard/account/billing_history\" target=\"_blank\">\"Billing History\" to check your <em>Current Balance.</em></a></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">My invoice was for a larger amount than usual.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most of the time, charges will match up with weekly spend. However, when activity on your account affects your required balance, you may be charged more or less than your spend for that week. To find out what factored into the amount you were charged, review that week's invoice in <a href=\"https://app.adroll.com/dashboard/account/billing_history\" target=\"_blank\">\"Billing History\"</a>.</p>",
