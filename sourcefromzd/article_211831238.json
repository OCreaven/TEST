They’re everywhere on the internet. Think of a website that you are a member of - for example, Facebook. Have you ever noticed that once you’ve signed in, you don’t have to sign in again the next time you visit? Well that is done through the magic of cookies - tiny data packets stored in your browser that turn the internet into </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> internet.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s how retargeting works. When someone visits your website, your SmartPixel places a cookie in their browser. As long as that cookie remains in their browser, we’ll recognize that they’ve been to your website and help you reconnect!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Do I get to choose where my ads appear?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You decide where you want to serve your ads, on the wider web or Facebook. We work to make sure that every impression counts by reaching the right visitor, at the right time, to get them to convert.
