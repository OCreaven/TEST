A positive return on your investment means that you're making more than you've spent. A negative return on your investment means that you're losing money on your investment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>To calculate ROI divide the amount returned by the amount invested.</strong></p>\r\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"2px\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">ROI in practice:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You invest $25 into advertising. After a week of advertising, you make $60 back.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">ROI = 60 (the amount you made) /25 (the amount spent) = 2.4</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1 wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">In the above scenario, you made back 2.4x what you spent, or $2.40 per $1 you put in.

You can learn more about setting this up, here.</p>\r\n<p>As for giving each success a value, you can <a href=\"#1\">define a fixed value</a> or use enhanced conversion tracking to <a href=\"#2\">track order values dynamically</a>.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><a name=\"1\"></a><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">1.

A fixed value for each conversion means that each conversion is worth the same amount to you. If order values for your business do not change much from order to order, this is a good option for you as it is easy to add to your conversion segment.</p>\r\n<p>If you already have a conversion segment, edit it to add a conversion value. The conversion value you add will apply to conversions going forward.</p>\r\n<p><strong>To calculate how much revenue your campaign has generated (for fixed values), multiply the number of <em>attributed</em> conversions by your conversion value.</strong></p>\r\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"2px\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1 wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Calculating attributed revenue with a fixed conversion value:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1 wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">You set your conversion value as $20, and subsequently we log 20 conversions that can be attributed to one of your campaigns.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Attributed revenue = $20 x 20 = $400</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><a name=\"2\"></a><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2. Dynamic value (Enhanced Conversion Tracking)</span></p>\r\n<p>If you have an e-commerce store, order values will most likely differ from customer to customer. In this case, it is more accurate to use enhanced conversion tracking to dynamically capture your order values (translation: capture what your customer actually spent on their order).</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>For an explanation of how enhanced conversion tracking works and general instructions for setting it up, click <a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/212629938\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Check if we have specific enhanced conversion tracking instructions for your platform, <a href=\"/hc/en-us/categories/201557907\">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>",
