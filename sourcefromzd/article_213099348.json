Your website must be complete, polished, and fully functional.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Retargeting helps by maximizing the value of your existing traffic, not by driving new traffic to your business. If your website is brand new or still under construction, you may want to consider placing your <a title=\"What is a SmartPixel?\" href=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/201922090#content-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">SmartPixel</a> so we can begin building an audience as you focus on growing your online presence. You can begin running campaigns when your website traffic is more robust. Ultimately, how you decide to allocate your marketing budget is up to you. However, we do have the following requirements for all websites that join our program:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your website must be fully functional. We cannot send visitors to a “Coming Soon!” landing page.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All navigation links must be fully functional and lead to active pages.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All pages must be complete. Having active links to pages that are under construction or blank may be grounds for disapproval.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Be sure to proofread your website for spelling or grammatical errors.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><a name=\"2\"></a><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2. Visitors should be able to easily understand your business.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Transparency is one of our core values and we require advertisers to be similarly transparent with their users. Please make sure your website complies with the following checklist:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The “mission statement” test: While a mission statement is not explicitly required, visitors should be able to summarize your website’s purpose or function through the information available on your website or landing page, without having to submit their personal information.</li>\r\n<li>Clear and accurate explanation of your product or service offering\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Clear:</strong> AdRoll.com provides retargeting solutions on the web and Facebook.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Not clear:</strong> Join AdRoll.com today and increase conversions by 300%!!!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Explicit terms of engagement\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>For retail:</strong> clear pricing, up-front explanation of payment methods, shipping and handling terms, etc.</li>\r\n<li><strong>For service providers:</strong> up-front explanation of what the customer can expect to receive, membership/commitment terms, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/201827474#PP\">A complete privacy policy</a>.</li>\r\n<li>An “About Us” section</li>\r\n<li>Business contact information</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><a name=\"3\"></a><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">3. Your website must provide added value.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To be eligible for retargeting, your website must provide unique value to your visitors. Ask yourself the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Is the primary content of your website proprietary (owned by you)? This includes sponsored content featured on your website. See<a href=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/201827474#publishers\">Ad Publishers</a> for more information.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>If your website aggregates content from third parties, does it provide additional value that the original content provider does not? (e.g., customer reviews, unique comparison tools)</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Does your website clearly communicate that value to your visitor?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you answered yes to the above questions, then yes, your website demonstrates unique value.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"4\"></a><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">4. Your website must be able to stand by its claims.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All content on your website should be relevant, accurate, informative, and up to date. Any claims should be easily verifiable. If a warranty or guarantee is offered, the terms of the agreement must be clear to your site visitors. We will not promote websites that intentionally misrepresent their business or use any tactic to falsely enhance reputation or misrepresent actual offerings. Possible tactics include the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Staged reviews or testimonials</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Inaccurate claims of certification (such as BBB accreditation)</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Fake endorsements (from media or other organizations)</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Misleading or unclear terms of use</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><a name=\"5\"></a><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">5. Content should be family safe and age appropriate.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Please make sure that your website is family safe. Your website should not contain nudity, adult products, mature concepts, violent themes, and vulgar language. Remember, we don't make the rules on what is considered \"inappropriate\", social norms do.</p>\r\n<p>On the other end, also make sure that your website content is not messaged towards children under 13 either.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><a name=\"6\"></a><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">6. No spam.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Spam tactics are content or functional strategies that distract without providing any practical value in clarifying understanding or enhancing visitor experience. Whether it is immediately apparent or not, we do not allow it. Well known examples of spam include spam emails and pop-ups. Here are a few more:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Excessive use of punctuation, fonts, or font formatting</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Any strategy that interferes with browser functionality (blocks users from using the back button or closing windows)</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Strategies that mimic system functions to trick visitors into completing an action</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Websites that prompt users to download additional software in order to display website elements</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The use of spyware or malware </p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",
