You can run these campaigns on the web or Facebook.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"2\"></a><strong>How does it work?</strong></span><br />Instead of making an educated guess on what your ideal customer might look like, Prospecting leverages your anonymous customer data to find audiences that act like your converted users, driving the highest value new users possible.</p>\r\n<p> <em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Visual learner?

When will it be available to me?</strong></span><br />Prospecting is currently available for select advertisers and will become available to more advertisers on a rolling basis. You can join our waitlist, <a href=\"https://www.adroll.com/product/prospecting\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. If youâ€™d like to keep track of availability, please follow <a href=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/admin/articles/204984150-Frequently-Asked-Prospecting-Questions/blog.adroll.com\" target=\"_blank\">our blog</a> and lookout for an update in your email inbox.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"4\"></a><strong>What are the requirements for running Prospecting?</strong></span><br />We have 2 requirements to run a Prospecting campaign:</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">1.</span> Before running Prospecting, we require you run a Retargeting campaign. This is because we want to do well at converting the low hanging fruit on your website so that our algorithm can understand your online customers.<br /><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2.</span> Opt in to the IntentMap.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"5\"></a><strong>Do I have to opt in to run Prospecting?</strong></span><br />Yes, this is one of two requirements for prospecting. Opting in allows us to learn from your online customers and identify the best possible users to target from our data set.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"6\"></a><strong>Will Prospecting send my website traffic to my competitors?</strong></span><br />No. We never transfers cookies from one advertiser to another. Additionally, we do not allow other advertisers to target your segments.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><a name=\"7\"></a><strong>Is this a good option for small websites?</strong></span><br />Absolutely. What's important is that we have enough high intent data to inform our understanding of what makes your customer tick. Running a Retargeting campaign (a requirement for eligibility) provides us with the insight we need to build a strong Prospecting actalike segment. We'll take what we learn to drive new and <em>engaged</em> traffic to your site - people who will stick around and explore different pages and products on your website rather than bounce off of your homepage.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>If you are interested in running a prospecting campaign in the future, <a href=\"https://www.adroll.com/product/prospecting\" target=\"_blank\">let us know</a>!</em></p>",
