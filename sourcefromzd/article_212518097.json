To learn how your account balance factors into weekly billing, click <a href=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/203729920#content-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>This credit can be put towards paying for ad deliveries OR to cover the budget of a newly approved campaign (as long as you have enough to cover the full budgeted amount). It never expires and will continue to supplement your costs until it runs out. That means if you leave your account idle for a year and come back, your credit will be waiting for you with open arms.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"2\"></a><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">How do I redeem my promo code?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>If you have a specific promo code to redeem, you will enter it on the last step of campaign creation.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203003128/campaign_review_promocode_en-us.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Click on the “Have a promo code?” link to expose the promo code field. Copy and paste your promo code into the textbox that appears.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202933277/promo_field_en-us.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>If a <strong>red X</strong> appears, check your promo code again and make sure that it matches the promo code given to you exactly. Promo codes are case sensitive. The example below illustrates what happens when there is an error preventing us from accepting your promo code.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203003608/promo_error_en-us.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>If the promo code field disappears after you click out of it, then your code was accepted. Make sure you launch your campaign to complete the process.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"3\"></a><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">I am sure my promo code is correct, but it is not getting accepted.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Reach out to delight@adroll.com and we’d be happy to look it up for you. If this is a system error, we’ll apply it manually. If it’s expired, send us the page or email that you grabbed it from, and we’ll honor that promotion—just for you!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"4\"></a><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Will my promo code be redeemed if my campaign is not approved?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>When you submit a promo code, it does not get applied until your campaign has been approved. If your campaign is not approved and you’re launching a new campaign, make sure that you enter your promo code again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"5\"></a><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">How can I make sure that my promo code was applied?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>You can check your account balance in “Billing History.”</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Log into your AdRoll dashboard.</li>\r\n<li>Go to settings (gear icon in the top right corner)</li>\r\n<li>Select “Billing History” in the settings menu.</li>\r\n<li><em>Current Balance</em> shows the amount of credit you have, currently, in your account balance.
