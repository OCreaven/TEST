As you go on to refine your future campaigns, comparing new activity against this baseline will help you see if you're headed in the right direction with changes to strategy, creative, or optimizations. As the man hailed as \"The Father of Advertising\" said:</p>\r\n<table style=\"height: 67px; background-color: #f9fcfd;\" border=\"2px\" width=\"553\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">\"Never stop testing, and your advertising will never stop improving.\" </span></em><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ogilvy_(businessman)\" target=\"_blank\">David Ogilvy</a></span></em></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Budget</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Start with</strong> <strong>$30.</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be conservative with your estimate.

This is the segment you will want to target with your first campaign.

Remember that your audience is made up of people that have already been to your website! Demonstrating value that the user may have missed on their first visit can help drive engagement.
