If you previously specified a conversion value, please edit your conversion segment and delete it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204265807/trackconversions_avgvalue_en-us.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Building on Basic Conversion Tracking</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>AdRoll’s SmartPixel and dashboard provide an easy way to set up basic conversion tracking through URL segmentation. Any time a visitor lands on a page that represents completion of the desired action, for example <a href=\"http://www.example.com/thankyou\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.example.com/thankyou</a>, a conversion event could be triggered and attributed to your advertising.</p>\r\n<p>If you would like to get a more granular insight into the context of each attributable conversion, you'll need to add our enhanced conversion tracking javascript code to your conversion page(s). This code will instruct our SmartPixel to pass back additional variables, such as order value or ID, along with the conversion event.</p>\r\n<p>Implementing enhanced conversion tracking requires a little more technical expertise, so you will want to work with someone who has familiarity with your website. You will need to know:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How to access your conversion page HTML</li>\r\n<li>Variable names pertaining to the information you would like to track alongside each attributable conversion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">How to Pass Revenue Value of Conversions</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Because revenue is the most commonly used attribute that can be passed with conversions, AdRoll has implemented a specific conversion variable for order amounts that is recognized by the AdRoll SmartPixel.  When a value is assigned to this variable, it will show up in your AdRoll dashboard.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #808080; font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;\"><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204265787/trackconversions_attrrevenue_en-us.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>On the HTML of your success page, you will need to add additional javascript <em>below your SmartPixel. </em>The script will instruct your SmartPixel to recognize the variable that logs the order amount assigned to the conversion.</p>\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/adroll-isabelle/50a11252d4826e3a9299.js\"></script>\r\n<p>This revenue variable name (<em>X</em>) used is unique to each website and e-commerce platform. In order to determine the correct variable name you will want to make sure to refer to the proper documentation from your respective platform.</p>\r\n<p>If the revenue variable is correctly named, then <em>X</em> will automatically populate the order amount as actual conversions occur.</p>\r\n<p>If you would like to verify that you have implemented the revenue variable correctly, trigger a test transaction! Then, check the HTML of your conversion page. The revenue value (<em>X)</em> should be replaced with the actual order amount logged. In the example below, the order amount recorded is $49.95.</p>\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/adroll-isabelle/7b56a4a9e0393c29e944.js\"></script>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>How to Pass Custom Currencies</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>AdRoll defaults to reporting revenue values in USD. If you would like to have revenue values reported in a custom currency, you will need to make a small additional adjustment to the script, replacing \"USD\" with <a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/205829000#content-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">the three letter code that represents your desired currency</a>.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">adroll_conversion_value = X;<br />adroll_currency = \"Y\"</pre>\r\n<p>As instructed in the previous section, <em>X</em> is replaced by your platform's revenue variable name. Then, replace <em>Y</em> with a<a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/205829000#content-anchor\" target=\"_blank\"> supported currency code</a> being sure to include the specified quotation marks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We can currently set your dashboard up to report in the following currencies: US Dollars (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pound Sterling (GBP), Australian Dollar (AUD), Japanese Yen (JPY)</li>\r\n<li>If you specify a different currency for enhanced conversion tracking than what is set on your dashboard, revenue tracked will be converted to your dashboard currency setting, based on daily exchange rates.</li>\r\n<li>If no currency code is specified, reporting defaults to USD</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 style=\"color: #2e3640; font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;\"> </h4>\r\n<h4 style=\"color: #2e3640; font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">How to Pass Additional Custom Values</span></strong></span></h4>\r\n<p>Any additional attributes about conversions can also be passed to AdRoll, and these values can then be accessed via a <a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/205272614#content-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">Granular Conversion Report (GCR)</a>, which you can pull from your dashboard by clicking the \"Generate Report\" button on the right sidebar and selecting the <em>Profile Overview</em> report type.</p>\r\n<p>Additional variables are passed by setting a javascript object with the name <strong>adroll_custom_data </strong>which encapsulates custom variables and values.</p>\r\n<p>The example script below is set up for passing values for Order ID and User ID, where <em>W</em> and <em>Z</em> should be replaced with the corresponding variable name as defined by your platform. </p>\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/anonymous/73e70f193d668edcbe3c.js\"></script>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>You can continue to define other information you want captured, as long as you know the corresponding variable name. Simply follow the format:</p>\r\n<pre><code>adroll_custom_data = {\"ORDER_ID\": W, \"USER_ID\": Z, \"custom_name\": A, “custom_name” : B}</code></pre>\r\n<p>Where \"custom_name\" is your name for the data you are trying to capture and <em>A </em>and <em>B</em> is replaced by the corresponding variable name.</p>\r\n<p>If you are interested in passing back additional custom data, please <a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/205272614#PII\" target=\"_blank\">make sure you are familiar with the types of information you are allowed to pass back</a>.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Passing Revenue and Custom Values Together</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>If you’d like to pass AdRoll both types of data, you can set both variables for revenue and custom values at the same time. Simply set <strong>adroll_conversion_value</strong>, <strong>adroll_currency</strong>, and <strong>adroll_custom_data</strong> variables consecutively in javascript.</p>",
