Sites that have more traffic are able to effectively spend more on retargeting. When setting up a campaign, advertisers should keep this factor in mind to ensure campaigns are successful and reaching their full potential.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When a new advertiser wants to setup a campaign, our account team suggests starting with the following ranges depending upon the size of the segment being targeted. Keep in mind, these Unique Visits (UV) are based on a 90 day cookie window:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>3,000 – 10,000 UV : $50 – $175 per week</li>\r\n<li>10,000 – 25,000 UV : $175 – $450 per week</li>\r\n<li>25,000 – 50,000 UV : $450 – $900 per week</li>\r\n<li>50,000 – 100,000 UV : $900 – $1800 per week</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These ranges are based on visitors accumulated over 90 day lists, and assume full inventory reach (general web retargeting and facebook exchange campaigns).</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\r\n<table style=\"background-color: #f9fcfd;\" border=\"2px\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">3 budgeting tips</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">1. <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Take advantage of promotions</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\" dir=\"ltr\">Big promotions such as product launches, discounts and viral campaigns can spike your website traffic. While the traffic increase may be short-lived, your retargeting lists will stay larger for longer than the promotion time period. You should take this into account when forecasting the costs and impact of the promotion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\" dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204301097/misc_promotions_en-us.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">2. <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Adjust budgets for seasonality</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\" dir=\"ltr\">Most businesses have seasonal rises and declines in site traffic and interest. A tax preparation website in the US may see increased site traffic from February through April. Vacation destinations and travel websites often have high and low seasons. Retail and ecommerce websites are skewed toward the holiday season.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\" dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://adrollv2external.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204301107/misc_seasonality_en-us.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">3. <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Changes in campaigns, ad frequency and list duration</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">Even a perfect traffic forecast and subsequent retargeting spend can be thrown out the window if you make major changes to your retargeting campaign settings. Launching new campaigns that focus on cart abandonment, product categories, sales, and special-events will have impacts on your budgets and retargeting spend.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>",
